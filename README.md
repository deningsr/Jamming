# Jamming Music App

## This project is my first web app built with React. It is intended to dispaly my knowledge of React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses React Components and interacts with the Spotify API to create custom playlists and save them to the users Spotify account.

## How to use the App

- Simply search for your favorite artists and see their top hits pop instantly.
- Add any desired songs to your own custom playlist.
- Give your playlist a name and save it!
- See it appear in your Spotify playlist and enjoy!
